        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

  - author: Judy A.
    quote: My husband and I have been working with Arizona Medicare Helpers for
      several years and have been extremely pleased with Trevor's knowledge,
      professionalism and integrity. We like that he represents multiple
      insurance companies and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of
      different plans - both advantage and supplemental. Medicare plans vary a
      lot and can be really confusing, so we really appreciate and trust his
      advice. We just met with Trevor today and found out that he now represents
      some non-Medicare plans, as well. Highly recommend.

    quote: I referred my parents to AZ Medicare Helpers (Trevor and Nicole) and they
      took the time to listen to their needs, understand how to lower their
      costs and increase their coverage.  I highly recommend this talented group
      of professionals!  Thank you AZ Medicare Helpers!!
