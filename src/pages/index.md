testimonials:
  - author: Judy A.
    quote: My husband and I have been working with Arizona Medicare Helpers for
      several years and have been extremely pleased with Trevor's knowledge,
      professionalism and integrity. We like that he represents multiple
      insurance companies and can compare the advantages and disadvantages of
      different plans - both advantage and supplemental. Medicare plans vary a
      lot and can be really confusing, so we really appreciate and trust his
      advice. We just met with Trevor today and found out that he now represents
      some non-Medicare plans, as well. Highly recommend.

      took the time to listen to their needs, understand how to lower their
      costs and increase their coverage.  I highly recommend this talented group
      of professionals!  Thank you AZ Medicare Helpers!!
